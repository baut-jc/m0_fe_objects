# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
* I struggled with understanding the last problem where it look very similar with Challenge2. I read the same prompt over and over again causing me to get into an unproductive struggle.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
* Note taking is a great source for me to refer to when I forget some technical things. It also helps when I'm making a mistake. I write down my code and try to translate the syntax of it, away from the computer, so that gives me space to analyze and reflect on it.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
* I try to solve the code first. After a few lengthy reflection on it, then I google. I should minimize to just 2 minutes of decoding only 5 codes.
